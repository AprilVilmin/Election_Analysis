# Electing with Python: Analysis of Python Code Written for Colorodo Board of Elections


## Overview of Election Audit
Company XYZ has been hired to aid Tom in creating a Python script to help audit of a Colorado congressional district. Company XYZ has been tasked with writing code for many metrics in Python including, but not limited to: counting the number of votes, the percentage of votes for each candidate, the number of votes for each candidate, and the winner, the county with the most votes, the number of votes per county and the percentage of votes per county. This has been done in Excel in the past, but Tom's manager wants to look at doing it automatically in the future. If this is successful it will be used in our districts and other types of elections in the future.

##Election Audit Summary

In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Being new to Python, one of the biggest issues that myself and others at company XYZ faced was troubleshooting issues found. It was nice when the code editor would tell you what line the error was on, but sometimes the error would be caused by something on another line. There were other times when the issue wouldn't throw an error, but it was obvious that one was there when you compared it to the exepected results on the challenge.
